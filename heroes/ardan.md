# Ardan

Protects allies with barriers & traps enemies inside a large cage.

#### Heroic Perk: Julia's Gift

Ardan benefits from purchasing health items.

* Whenever Ardan takes damage, he heals for 0.8% of his missing health, but no more than 75% of the damage taken.
* Instead of energy, Ardan uses a yellow meter called Vengeance.

* Because Ardan doesn't need regular energy, 5% of bonus energy & 50% of bonus energy recharge are converted to crystal power.

#### Ability A: Vanguard

Arden dashes to protect an ally, granting them a 4s barrier & a burst of move speed. This also slows & damages nearby enemies.

* Overdrive: At max rank, Vanguard grants 30% Vengeance when cast on an ally.
* Using this ability on himself results in only half the barrier, speed boost & Vengeance gain.
* Barrier scales up with 30% of Ardan's bonus health.
* Any time this ally takes damage, Ardan gains Vengeance.
