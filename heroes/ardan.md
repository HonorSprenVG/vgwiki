Protects allies with barriers & traps enemies inside a large cage.

#### Heroic Perk: Julia's Gift

Ardan benefits from purchasing health items.

* Whenever Ardan takes damage, he heals for 0.8% of his missing health, but no more than 75% of the damage taken.
* Instead of energy, Ardan uses a yellow meter called Vengeance.

* Because Ardan doesn't need regular energy, 5% of bonus energy & 50% of bonus energy recharge are converted to crystal power.
