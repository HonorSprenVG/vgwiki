# Blackfeather

Evasive fighter who excels at chasing & cleaning up fragile enemies.

#### Heroic Perk: Heartthrob

Blackfeather's attacks & abilities apply Heartthrob stacks to enemies. Any time stacks are added or refreshed, Blackfeather deals bonus crystal damage for each stack already on the target.

* Bonus damage: 5 - 10 \(level 1-12\) \(+15% of crystal power\)
* Max 2 stacks on minions & monsters, 5 stacks on heroes & objectives.
* Stacks appear as broken hearts around enemies.
* Instead of energy, Blackfeather uses Focus for his abilities. This is capped at 100 & naturally regenerates 10 per second. Blackfeather also recovers an additional 10 focus for each basic attack he lands.
