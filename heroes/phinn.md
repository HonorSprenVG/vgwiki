# Phinn

Extremely tanky & can pull in enemies from across the screen.

#### Heroic Perk: Unstoppable

Phinn cannot be stopped or stunned. All movement-impairing effects are instead reduced to moderate slows, & stuns are converted to silences.

* He even shrugs off attempts on his life, passively gaining 18% additional armor, shield & max health from items & effects.
