# Alpha

Killing machine who can resurrect herself.

#### Heroic Perk:

Instead of dying, Alpha initiates a 4.5s reboot sequence. If her reboot health is not destroyed before time runs out, she will return to life.

When alive, Alpha's special energy bar shows the time until Infinite Reboot is available. When rebooting, the bar counts diwn to when she will revive.
