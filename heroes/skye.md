# Skye

Versatile, elusive mech pilot who can flank enemies from any angle.

#### Heroic Perk: Target Lock

Skye's basic attacks apply Target Lock to the last target.

* Basic attacks & Forward Barrage on that locked target grant her up to +2 move speed for 1.2s, but this boost is much weaker while moving backward.
* Target Lock lasts 3s & is lost when the target is more than 8.5 meters away.
