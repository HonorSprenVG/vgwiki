# Ban

In ranked games and draft mode games each team can 'ban' three heroes at the start of hero selection. If a hero is banned he/she cannot be played by either team for that match.

Ban could also refer to banning an account from playing or from posting on the forums. Forum bans are handed out when a player breaks the forum rules.

Banning an account from playing is done when a player is found to be breaking the games 'Terms of Use'. 

# BD

Backdoor; to attack a turret or vain crystal without any minions or hero backup. You have snuck into the enemies stronghold 'through the backdoor'.  


# BG

Bad game. This can be said by the winning team should the losing team have a disconnection or an afk as a means of good sportsmanship, in recognizing that they won because it was an uneven match and not because they are better. Similarly, it can be said by losing team to indicate that they didn't think it was a good game because they had a dc, afk, troller, etc...

This can also be used by ragers to indicate that it wasn’t a good game because they played badly or because their team was bad.
