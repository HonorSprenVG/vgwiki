Np - No problem

  


  


Nuke – Dealing a large amount of damage in a short time, also called burst. Sometimes people also use nuke to refer to dealing a large amount of area damage.

OP - Overpowered or original post.

  


  


Overextending - A champion moving too far in lane/enemy territory, which can open them up to ganks. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether someone is overextending or split pushing. \(definition by zigomorfico\)

  


  


  


  


Passive – An ability that has a more permanent effect. This can be a q, w, e, r or innate ability. But most often, when people say passive, they simply refer to your innate. See innate for more information.

Pull - A pull is the first hit on a jungle monster, done by someone other than the person going to kill the monster. For example: if Warwick wants to kill the blue golem then Brand could do the first hit on that golem and then go away. This ensures that the blue golem will end up chasing Brand for a while before attacking Warwick. During this time Warwick can keep hitting the blue golem without taking any damage. It will usually be a few seconds before the blue golem realizes Brand is gone and will start attacking Warwick. These few seconds can often make the difference between the jungler being able to kill the blue or not being able to kill the blue golem \(though in this case with Warwick as he can always take on blue easily\).

  


  


Push – To advance in lane towards the enemy nexus with the intention of destroying towers, inhibitors or the nexus.
