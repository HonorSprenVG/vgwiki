# AD

# AFK

# Agro

To have tower agro means the tower is targeting \(and so attacking\) you. You can lose tower aggro by stepping out of range of the tower. You can gain tower aggro by being the first to step within tower range. Or if you enter within range of the tower, say after your minions, then you can still get tower aggro by attacking an enemy champion while under the tower.

# AoE

Area of Effect. AoE spells are spells that do damage in an area as opposed to just on one target.

# AP 

Ability Power

  
AP Mid

The mage that takes the mid lane. See laning arrangement at the bottom of this page for more info.
